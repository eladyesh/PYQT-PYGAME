# PYQT-PYGAME

This repository contains a collection of PyQt example programs for learning and practicing PyQt programming. PyQt is a set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework and library.

## Games
This repository includes three popular games implemented in PyQt:
- Tetris
- Space Invaders
- Flappy Bird

Each game is implemented using PyQt5 and comes with its own set of instructions and controls.

### Tetris
Tetris is a classic tile-matching puzzle game. The objective of the game is to stack falling blocks in such a way that they create a horizontal line without any gaps. When a line is completed, it disappears and any blocks above it shift down.

The game can be played using the arrow keys to move and rotate the blocks.

### Space Invaders
Space Invaders is a classic arcade game where the player must defeat an alien invasion. The player controls a spaceship that can move left or right and shoot at the alien ships above.

The game can be played using the arrow keys to move the spaceship and the space bar to shoot.

### Flappy Bird
Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird that must navigate through a series of obstacles. The player must tap the screen to make the bird flap its wings and fly upwards.

The game can be played using the space bar to flap the bird's wings.
