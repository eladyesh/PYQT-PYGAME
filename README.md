  <h1>PYQT-PYGAME</h1>
  <p>This repository contains a collection of PyQt example programs for learning and practicing PyQt programming. PyQt is a set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework and library.</p>
  <h2>Games</h2>
  <p>This repository includes three popular games implemented in PyQt:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tetris</li>
    <li>Space Invaders</li>
    <li>Flappy Bird</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each game is implemented using PyQt5 and comes with its own set of instructions and controls.</p>
  <h3>Tetris</h3>
  <p>Tetris is a classic tile-matching puzzle game. The objective of the game is to stack falling blocks in such a way that they create a horizontal line without any gaps. When a line is completed, it disappears and any blocks above it shift down.</p>
  <p>The game can be played using the arrow keys to move and rotate the blocks.</p>
  <h3>Space Invaders</h3>
  <p>Space Invaders is a classic arcade game where the player must defeat an alien invasion. The player controls a spaceship that can move left or right and shoot at the alien ships above.</p>
  <p>The game can be played using the arrow keys to move the spaceship and the space bar to shoot.</p>
  <h3>Flappy Bird</h3>
  <p>Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird that must navigate through a series of obstacles. The player must tap the screen to make the bird flap its wings and fly upwards.</p>
  <p>The game can be played using the space bar to flap the bird's wings.</p>
  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>To run any of the games, you need to have Python and PyQt5 installed on your machine. You can install PyQt5 by running the following command:</p>
  <pre><code>pip install pyqt5</code></pre>
  <p>To run a game, simply navigate to its directory and run the following command:</p>
  <pre><code>python &lt;game_name&gt;.py</code></pre>
